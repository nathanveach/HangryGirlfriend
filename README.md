Hangry Girlfriend 👿

https://hangrygirlfriend.herokuapp.com/

Fun App using a fully React front end to connect with a Rails API.

React front end relays users geolocation to Rails API when the component mounts.

Rails controller takes users coordinates and makes a call to Yelp's fusion API for Nearby restaurants that will be open for atleast the next 30 minutes.

Rails API handles the response and renders it as a JSON object, which is easily parsed with React.

Using Javascript and CSS a business is randomly selected and displayed nicely on the mobile optimized front end.
